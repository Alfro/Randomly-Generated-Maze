Randomly-Generated Maze Project in Python 

Update 1 (24/9): 
Have implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to improve opponent movement. Still slightly buggy, but a huge improvement on the previous AI. 

The maze uses Prim's Algorithm for maze generation, finding a minimum spanning tree of the square lattice on which the maze is set. It features two playable characters and some AI (currently undergoing improvement) for the opposing player. 

This project has improved my skills with: 

- Using pygame to draw basic 2D graphics and imported sprites; 
- Implementing basic OOP and operator overloading; 
- Using my mathematical knowledge to solve programming problems.
